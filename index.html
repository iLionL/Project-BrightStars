                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>The BrightStars quality rating and improvement system was developed by a team of local early
                        childhood and school-age care professionals and reviewed by national experts. Parents with
                        children enrolled in child care and early learning programs were consulted to better understand
                        the information that would be most helpful for families. BrightStars is managed by the Rhode
                        Island Association for the Education of Young Children (RIAEYC).Rhode Island KIDS COUNT
                        coordinated the design phase and continues to provide support for evaluation and marketing.</p>
